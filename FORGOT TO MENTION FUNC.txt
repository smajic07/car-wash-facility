When creating a customer, if email field is not empty, an e-mail message is going to be sent to the email address entered
letting the email owner know that an account with his email credentials has been created on this Car Wash Facility.
Every car wash an email message is sent to a customer letting him know how many more times he needs to wash his car to get 
a discount. (If he got a discount on the last car wash this is going to be the content of the email)

Live updating contents of DataGrid table of Car Washes when adding another car wash, for a customer, and for a car wash program.
That's not all, live update is happening even on the card of a customer or a car wash program because this car wash that we just added
need to be added to the number of car washes for a customer/car wash program, and also it can be modulo 10 wash so we need to inc the 
number of discounted car wash programs on the front-end in real time (immidiately) :)
